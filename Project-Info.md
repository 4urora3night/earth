# Information

### Versioning
The scheme is as follows:
`{(Epoch * 100) + Major} . Minor . Patch` \
This is similar to [Epoch Semantic Versioning](https://antfu.me/posts/epoch-semver).
### Commit format
The commits are based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
so I can also use then in the changelogs.
